# Report on the Neural Network Model for Alphabet Soup

## Overview of the Analysis
The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup required a machine learning tool to assist in selecting applicants for funding with the highest likelihood of success in their ventures. To fulfill this need, a binary classifier was developed using a neural network approach. The classifier aims to predict the probability of an applicant's success if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The dataset provided by Alphabet Soup's business team included over 34,000 records of organizations that had received funding. The dataset featured various metadata columns, such as application type, sector affiliation, government classification, use case for funding, organization type, active status, income classification, special considerations, requested funding amount, and success outcome.

## Data Preprocessing
Target Variable: The 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column, indicating the effectiveness of the money used, was the target variable for our model.
Feature Variables: Key features included 'APPLICATION_TYPE', 'AFFILIATION', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'STATUS', 'INCOME_AMT', 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS', and 'ASK_AMT'.
Variables to Remove: Identification columns like 'EIN' and 'NAME' were removed as they do not contribute to the predictive capability of the model.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
Model Architecture: The model comprised three hidden layers with 80, 40, and 20 neurons, respectively. I used 'relu' activation for hidden layers for its efficiency and 'sigmoid' for the output layer, suitable for binary classification.
Performance: The highest achieved accuracy was approximately 73.15% on the test set, falling short of the desired 75% target.

## Improvement Strategies:
Increased neuron counts and added batch normalization for better learning.
Adjusted dropout rates to prevent overfitting.
Switched from SGD to Adam optimizer for better optimization.

## Summary and Recommendations
The developed deep learning model demonstrated moderate success, with an accuracy of about 73.15%, in predicting the effective use of funds by organizations. While it shows potential, there's room for improvement to meet the desired accuracy target of 75%.

## Recommendation for Alternative Approach:
Random Forest Classifier: Given its ability to handle non-linear relationships and provide insights into feature importance, a Random Forest Classifier could offer a valuable alternative. This model is less prone to overfitting and can be more interpretable, which might better suit Alphabet Soup's needs for understanding and predicting successful funding applications.
